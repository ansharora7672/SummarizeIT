    "response": "The video explains the differences between four different approaches to project management: waterfall, iterative, incremental, and agile.\n\n1. Waterfall Approach: This approach is suitable when all the requirements are known and clearly understood at the beginning of the project. The project phases are sequential and progress from one phase to another, such as design, preparation, and finishing.\n\n2. Iterative Approach: This approach is used when the requirements are not known at the start of the project. It involves creating a basic version of the product and refining it through subsequent iterations until the final product meets all customer requirements.\n\n3. Incremental Approach: This approach is used when dealing with complex requirements. It involves delivering functional increments of the product, starting with important features that the customer can start using. New features are then added with each increment until the final product is delivered.\n\n4. Agile Approach: This approach is the most preferred for addressing complex adaptive problems. It combines the iterative and incremental approaches. Smaller increments of the product are delivered, and the product is refined through iterations based on customer feedback and changing requirements. It allows for flexibility and adaptation throughout the project.\n\nIn summary, the differences lie in the sequencing and delivery of the project phases, as well as the handling of unknown or changing requirements. The waterfall approach is sequential, the iterative approach refines the product through iterations, the incremental approach delivers functional increments, and the agile approach combines iteration and increment delivery while adapting to changing requirements.",
